## Stream encryption with Cogito

Cogito supports encryption of arbitrary large content.

> We can now easily add some basic documentation to the demo pages
we create in the demo app. The nice thing is that we can write it
Markdown and then just include in `public/documentation` directory
to finally refer to it in the given component.

Let's see some code:

```javascript
let a = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])
```
